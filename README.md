## Abstract
<p align="left">      Secure Nest is an automated security solution for residential complexes, enhancing safety and streamlining access control. It uses object detection, license plate recognition, and face recognition to ensure secure entry. For vehicles, cameras scan license plates to match registered residents, granting access upon a match. For pedestrians, face recognition verifies identities against stored profiles.
The system features a dual-portal visitor management setup, allowing residents to preauthorize entry by generating a one-time password sent to the visitor’s mobile. This password, combined with the flat number, enables access. </p>
